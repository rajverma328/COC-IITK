# Playground Folder
The `PLAYGROUND` folder is your experimental space 🚀! It's where all the magic happens, from major milestones to all the little tweaks and fidgeting along the way. Whether it's testing new ideas, refining features, or just having some fun with code, this is where creativity meets functionality. Dive in to see the journey, trials, and triumphs that have shaped the project!🎨🔧

## 🚀 The Epic Journey of This Project

Every great project starts with a humble beginning (and a lot of Googling). This one was no exception. Let's dive into the milestones, each requiring countless *"Why isn't this working?!"* moments, multiple cups of coffee, and many iterations.

### 🏗️ Milestone 1: The Frontend Fiasco
Ah, the frontend. Where things look pretty, but behind the scenes, it's mostly chaos.

- **Iteration 1:** Slapped together some HTML and CSS. Looked like a website... if it were 1995. 
- **Iteration 2:** JavaScript entered the chat. Buttons started doing things! (Sort of.)
- **Iteration 3:** Responsive design... because apparently, people don’t just use desktop monitors anymore? Hello, mobile users.
- **Iteration 4:** Final UI polish! By now, it *almost* looked like something you'd want to show off to friends. 🎉

### 📊 Milestone 2: The Great CSV Conundrum
Ah, yes. This was the moment where I stared into the abyss... and it stared back. Extracting course data from a CSV and organizing it into a pristine JSON format seemed easy at first. It wasn’t.

- **Iteration 1:** Opened the CSV file. 3000+ rows of course data?! It felt like reading a phone book.
- **Iteration 2:** Started writing code to parse the CSV. Every comma felt like a potential disaster waiting to happen.
- **Iteration 3:** JSON conversion. It was like trying to turn a spaghetti monster into a well-behaved data structure. The JSON format had never looked so glorious.
- **Iteration 4:** Implemented clash detection. Had a brief existential crisis while figuring out which classes clashed (spoiler: a lot of them). Used some nifty logic to finally resolve all those pesky conflicts. 🎉


### 🛠️ Milestone 3: Backend Battle Royale
Here’s where things get serious. The backend—where all the magic happens, and by magic, I mean endless debugging.

- **Iteration 1:** Set up the backend. No one knew what was happening, but we had a server running... kind of. 
- **Iteration 2:** API-building madness. “Why is it always returning 404?” Ah yes, because it’s broken.
- **Iteration 3:** Connected the database. Now things were starting to get *real*. Data was flowing like... well, data.
- **Iteration 4:** After some intense optimizations (aka a couple of 'console.log's), the API worked! And it worked *fast*. 🚀

### 📅 Future Milestones:
Stay tuned for these future battles:
- **Milestone 4:** Deployment (aka “I hope it works on the server”)
- **Milestone 5:** Testing (yes, real testing, not just refreshing the page)

And there you have it. A journey filled with blood, sweat, tears, and more commands than I'd like to admit. But in the end, it was all worth it. Probably.
